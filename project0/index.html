                <p>Programming is important for speeding up the input and output processes in a machine. Programming is important to automate, collect, manage, calculate, analyze the processing of data and information accurately. <br>
                    Programming is important to create software and applications that help computer and mobile users in daily life. Due to all these reasons, it’s really important to learn how to use programming languages in our daily life.</p>

                “Learning to code has the inadvertent effect of teaching you how to think,” says Adrian Degus, CEO of Nuvro. He goes on to explain that he used to be more prone to solving problems emotionally. But his coding experience has taught him to approach problems logically.

                “Understanding logic, at a deep level, has improved my problem-solving proficiency tenfold,” he adds.

                Coding, in its most basic terms, is really just assigning a computer a task to do based on the logical guidelines you’ve outlined. Highly complex tasks are essentially a collection of smaller operations once you break them down. This methodical and logic-heavy approach to problem solving can be a boon for figuring out problems beyond a coding challenge.
